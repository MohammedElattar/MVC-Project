# No we gonna talk about .htaccess file that used to configure our apache server

# There are some rules we should know in htacces file that are standard in many commands

# First , we use - symbol to deny the command , + to allow that command

# if we want to change the default auto redirected page when we open our website link we use that command

# here for example we changed the default page to main.html if that page is not found it searches for index.php page

# DirectoryIndex main.html index.php

# To Prevent Follow Abbreviations that located out side our server root directory we use the following command

# Don't Follow Symbolic Links that are out side server directory

# OPTIONS -FollowSymLinks

# if i want to hide Server Signature that show when error occurs for example , when 404 Error occurs , below in that page we find the

# Server Name , version of that server , OS that working on , and the Port that used to run that server , and that is not secure at all

# for us to prevent us from hackers

# # ServerSignature OFF

OPTIONS -indexes

# If We want to redirect to a known page if the requested page is not found we use the following command

# # RewriteEngine on

# that we like make if statement if the request filename is not found !-f

# # RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

# and also if the directory doesn't exists

# # RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# we write . "which means everything in our website to a know page or any page we want" and the braces mens => L means last thing after everything , R=301 means that we do that all the time if that issue occurs

# # RewriteRule . /E_Commerce/main.html [L,R=301]

# Another Way to do that and it is more nice that the previous one we use that command

# # ErrorDocument "error_code" "the page we want to go"

# That will go to main.html page

# # ErrorDocument 404 /E_Commerce/main.html

# # ErrorDocument 403 /E_Commerce/main.html

# Prevent Directory Listing

# # OPTIONS -Indexes

# That will rewrite the url except the root server directory to index.php and $1 means that will make url Get variable has a value if the requested page that we write , QSA means that if there is a query string in our link , it will be appended to url Get variable
